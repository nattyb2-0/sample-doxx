1. you have to install redux and react-redux
2.inside index.js you have to create an instance of a store and pass it a reducer
 a)import create store from redux
 b) craete variable store with value of createstore function called with the reducer as parameter
 c)simple apps will have only one reducer...complicated will havw several amnd will need to combine them.
 d) for several...create reducer folder and create the reducers youre using plus a root reducer file.
 e)in each reducer file create a variable which holds a es6 arrow function which has 2 parameters: state={initState}, and action....this unction retrns the state

 ex const authReducer = (state={initState}, action) =>{
 	return state;
 }

 you must create an initState object to be passed in to the function incase their is no state within. and then export the function
 
 f) in the rootReducer file...import combineReducers from redux

 import all your reducer files

 create const variable named rootReucer and set it equal to initiation of combineReducers and pass in as an object a name value pair for each reducer

 ex....

 const rootreducer = combineReducers({
 	auth: authReducer,
 	note: notereducers
 })

 and export rootReducer to be passed in to the createStore function in index.js


 g0 in index.js import the root reducer variable 
 	then pass that variable into createStore()

 import provider from react-redux
 and wrap  app inside provider passing the tag a prop of store which is set = to the variable store that contained the instantiation of the create store function.
